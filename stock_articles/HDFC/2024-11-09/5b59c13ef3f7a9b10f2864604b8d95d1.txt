In a recent regulatory update, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced new measures to enhance transparency in the mutual fund industry. Beginning December 5, 2024, fund houses are required to distinctly disclose expenses and returns for both direct and regular mutual fund plans, providing investors with clearer information for decision-making. Additionally, SEBI has implemented a color-coded Risk-o-meter to help investors better gauge the risk level associated with various funds. The circular also mandates that any changes in risk levels be communicated in a standardized notification format. These initiatives are part of SEBI’s ongoing commitment to empower investors and promote informed choices within the mutual fund sector.

Sagility India witnessed an oversubscription of 3.20 times, Swiggy by 3.59 times, and ACME Solar Holdings by 2.89 times.
